Create a new layer if a different abstraction is needed.2. Each layer should have a well-defined function.3. The function of each layer is chosen based on internationallystandardizedprotocols.● Seven Layers:1. Physical Layer● It is the lowest layer of the OSI reference model.● It is used for the transmission of an unstructuredraw bit stream over a physicalmedium.● Physical layer transmits the data either in the formof electrical/optical ormechanical form.● The physical layer is mainly used for the physical connection between thedevices, and such physical connection can be madeby using twisted-pair cable,fibre-optic or wireless transmission media.\\n2.

It was developed by the US Department of Defence(DoD) in the 1860s. Thename of this model is based on 2 standard protocolsused i.e. TCP (TransmissionControl Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).1. Link: Decides which links such as serial lines orclassic Ethernet must be usedto meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer.Ex - Sonet, Ethernet2. Internet: The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the wholearchitecture together. It delivers the IP packetswhere they are supposed to bedelivered. Ex - IP, ICMP.3. Transport: Its functionality is almost the same asthe OSI transport layer. Itenables peer entities on the network to carry on aconversation. Ex - TCP, UDP(User Datagram Protocol)4. Application: It contains all the higher-level protocols.Ex - HTTP, SMTP, RTP,DNS.\\n● HTTP and HTTPS:\\nHTTP is theHyperText Transfer Protocolwhich definesthe set of rules and standardson how the information can be transmitted on the WorldWide Web (WWW).  It helps theweb browsers and web servers for communication. Itis a ‘stateless protocol’ where eachcommand is independent with respect to the previouscommand.HTTP is anapplication layer protocol built upon the TCP.

On top of HTTP, SSL/TLSprotocol is used to providesecurity.It enables secure transactions by encryptingthe communication and alsohelps identify network servers securely. It uses port443 by default.\\n● DNS (Imp):1. DNS is an acronym that stands for Domain Name System.DNSwas introducedby Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.2.

Once thedomainnameisentered, thenthedomainnamesystemwill translatethedomainnameinto the IP address which can be easily interpreted by the computer. Using the IPaddress, the computer can locate the web page requestedby the user.\\n● DNS Forwarder:A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it receives DNS queriesthat cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards thoserequests to external DNS serversfor resolution. A DNS server which is configured as a forwarder will behave differentlythan the DNS server which is not configured as a forwarder.\\n● SMTP Protocol :SMTP is theSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.SMTP sets the rule forcommunication between servers. This set of rules helpsthe software to transmit emailsover the internet. It supports both End-to-End andStore-and-Forward methods. It is inalways-listening mode on port 25.\\n● Difference Between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)and UDP (User DatagramProtocol):1. TCPis a connection-oriented protocol, whereasUDPis a connectionlessprotocol. A key difference between TCP and UDPisspeed, asTCPiscomparatively slower thanUDP. Overall,UDPis a muchfaster, simpler, andefficient protocol, however, retransmission of lostdata packets is only possiblewithTCP2. TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it providesflow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has onlythe basic errorchecking mechanism using checksums.'),\n",

These cookies just consist of a session ID, not the\\nactual data itself unless you explicitly use a cookie-based backend.\\n21.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What’s the use of Middleware in Django?\\nMiddleware is something that executes between the request and response. In simple\\nwords, you can say it acts as a bridge between the request and response. Similarly In\\nDjango when a request is made it moves through middlewares to views and data is\\npassed through middleware as a response.\\xa0\\n22.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is context in the Django?\\nContext is a dictionary mapping template variable name given to Python objects in\\nDjango. This is the general name, but you can give any other name of your choice if\\nyou want.\\nPage 16 © Copyright by Interviewbit\"),\n",

Render function is a shortcut function that lets the developer easily\\npass the data dictionary with the template. This function then combines the\\ntemplate with a data dictionary via templating engine. Finally, this render() returns as\\nHttpResponse with the rendered text, which is the data returned by models. Thus,\\nDjango render() bypasses most of the developer’s work and lets him use diﬀerent\\ntemplate engines.\\nThe basic syntax:\\nrender(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None,\\nusing=None)\\nThe request is the parameter that generates the response. The template name is the\\nHTML template used, whereas the context is a dict of the data passed on the page\\nfrom the python. You can also specify the content type, the status of the data you\\npassed, and the render you are returning.\\n24.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What’s the significance of the settings.py file?\\nAs the name suggests this file stores the configurations or settings of our Django\\nproject, like database configuration, backend engines, middlewares, installed\\napplications, main URL configurations, static file addresses, templating engines,\\nmain URL configurations, security keys, allowed hosts, and much more.\\n25.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How to view all items in the Model?\\nModelName.objects.all()\\n26.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How to filter items in the Model?\\nModelName.objects.filter(field_name=”term”)\\nAdvanced Django Interview Questions\\n27.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How to use file-based sessions?\\nTo use the same, you need to set the SESSION_ENGINE  settings to\\n\"django.contrib.sessions.backends.file\"\\nPage 17 © Copyright by Interviewbit'),\n",

It provides us with an excellent way to reuse\\ncode from multiple classes. One drawback of using these mixins is that it becomes\\ndiﬀicult to analyze what a class is doing and which methods to override in case of its\\ncode being too scattered between multiple classes.\\n29.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is Django Field Class?\\n'Field' refers to an abstract class that represents a column in the database table.\\xa0\\nThe Field class is just a subclass of RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are\\nused to create database tables (db_types()) which are used to map Python types to\\nthe database using get_prep_value() and the other way round using from_db_value()\\nmethod. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in diﬀerent Django APIs such as\\nmodels and querysets.\\n30.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Why is permanent redirection not a good option?\\nPermanent redirection is used only when you don’t want to lead visitors to the old\\nURLs. The response of the permanent redirections is cached by the browser so when\\nyou try to redirect to something else it will cause issues. Since this is a browser-side\\noperation if your user wants to move to a new page it will load the same page.\\n31.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Diﬀerence between Django OneToOneField and ForeignKey\\nField?\\nBoth of them are of the most common types of fields used in Django. The only\\ndiﬀerence between these two is that ForeignKey field consists of on_delete option\\nalong with a model’s class because it’s used for many-to-one relationships while on\\nthe other hand, the OneToOneField, only carries out a one-to-one relationship and\\nrequires only the model’s class.\\n32.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How can you combine multiple QuerySets in a View?\\nInitially, Concatenating QuerySets into lists is believed to be the easiest approach.\\nHere’s an example of how to do that:\\nfrom itertools import chain\\nresult_list = list(chain(model1_list, model2_list, model3_list))\\nPage 18 © Copyright by Interviewbit\"),\n",

If more than one item matches the given get() query. In this case, it’ll raise\\nMultipleObjectsReturned, which is also an attribute of the model class itself.\\n34.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How to obtain the SQL query from the queryset?\\nprint(queryset.query)\\n35.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What are the ways to customize the functionality of the\\nDjango admin interface?\\nThere are multiple ways to customize the functionality of the Django admin\\ninterface. You can piggyback on top of an add/change form that’s automatically\\ngenerated by Django, you can add JavaScript modules using the js parameter. This\\nparameter is basically a list of URLs that point to the JavaScript modules that are to\\nbe included in your project within a <script> tag. You can also write views for the\\nadmin if you want.\\n36.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Diﬀerence between select_related and prefetch_related?\\nThough both the functions are used to fetch the related fields on a model but their\\nfunctioning is bit diﬀerent from each other. In simple words, select_related uses a\\nforeign key relationship, i.e. using join on the query itself while on the\\nprefetch_related there is a separate lookup and the joining on the python side. Let’s\\ntry to illustrate this via an example:\\nPage 19 © Copyright by Interviewbit'),\n",

Render function is a shortcut function that lets the developer easily\\npass the data dictionary with the template. This function then combines the\\ntemplate with a data dictionary via templating engine. Finally, this render() returns as\\nHttpResponse with the rendered text, which is the data returned by models. Thus,\\nDjango render() bypasses most of the developer’s work and lets him use diﬀerent\\ntemplate engines.\\nThe basic syntax:\\nrender(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None,\\nusing=None)\\nThe request is the parameter that generates the response. The template name is the\\nHTML template used, whereas the context is a dict of the data passed on the page\\nfrom the python. You can also specify the content type, the status of the data you\\npassed, and the render you are returning.',\n",
