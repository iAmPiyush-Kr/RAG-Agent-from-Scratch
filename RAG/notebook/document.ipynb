It was developed by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in the 1860s. The\\nname of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e. TCP (Transmission\\nControl Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).\\n1.\\nLink : Decides which links such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used\\nto meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer. Ex - Sonet, Ethernet\\n2.\\nInternet : The internet layer is the most important layer which holds the whole\\narchitecture together. It delivers the IP packets where they are supposed to be\\ndelivered. Ex - IP, ICMP.\\n3.\\nTransport : Its functionality is almost the same as the OSI transport layer. It\\nenables peer entities on the network to carry on a conversation. Ex - TCP, UDP\\n(User Datagram Protocol)\\n4.\\nApplication : It contains all the higher-level protocols. Ex - HTTP, SMTP, RTP,\\nDNS.\\n●\\nHTTP and HTTPS :\\nHTTP is the HyperText Transfer Protocol which defines the set of rules and standards\\non how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web (WWW).  It helps the\\nweb browsers and web servers for communication. It is a ‘stateless protocol’ where each\\ncommand is independent with respect to the previous command. HTTP is an\\napplication layer protocol built upon the TCP. It uses port 80 by default.\\nHTTPS is the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure or Secure HTTP. It is an advanced\\nand secured version of HTTP. On top of HTTP, SSL/TLS protocol is used to provide\\nsecurity. It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication and also\\nhelps identify network servers securely. It uses port 443 by default.\\n●\\nDNS (Imp) :\\n1.\\nDNS is an acronym that stands for Domain Name System.DNS was introduced\\nby Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in 1983.\\n2.\\nIt is a naming system for all the resources over the internet which includes\\nphysical nodes and applications.

Using the IP\\naddress, the computer can locate the web page requested by the user.\\n●\\nDNS Forwarder : A forwarder is used with a DNS server when it receives DNS queries\\nthat cannot be resolved quickly. So it forwards those requests to external DNS servers\\nfor resolution. A DNS server which is configured as a forwarder will behave differently\\nthan the DNS server which is not configured as a forwarder.\\n●\\nSMTP Protocol : SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

It is an application layer\\nprotocol used to auto-configure devices on IP networks enabling them to use the TCP\\nand UDP-based protocols. The DHCP servers auto-assign the IPs and other network\\nconfigurations to the devices individually which enables them to communicate over the\\nIP network. It helps to get the subnet mask, IP address and helps to resolve the DNS. It\\nuses port 67 by default.\\n●\\nFTP : FTP is a File Transfer Protocol. It is an application layer protocol used to transfer\\nfiles and data reliably and efficiently between hosts. It can also be used to download files\\nfrom remote servers to your computer. It uses port 27 by default.\\n●\\nICMP : ICMP is the Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a network layer protocol\\nused for error handling. It is mainly used by network devices like routers for diagnosing\\nthe network connection issues and crucial for error reporting and testing if the data is\\nreaching the preferred destination in time. It uses port 7 by default.\\n●\\nARP : ARP is Address Resolution Protocol. It is a network-level protocol used to\\nconvert the logical address i.e. IP address to the device's physical address i.e. MAC\\naddress. It can also be used to get the MAC address of devices when they are trying to\\ncommunicate over the local network.\\n●\\nRIP :RIP stands for Routing Information Protocol. It is accessed by the routers to send\\ndata from one network to another. RIP is a dynamic protocol which is used to find the\\nbest route from source to the destination over a network by using the hop count\"),\n",

Render function is a shortcut function that lets the developer easily\\npass the data dictionary with the template. This function then combines the\\ntemplate with a data dictionary via templating engine. Finally, this render() returns as\\nHttpResponse with the rendered text, which is the data returned by models.

One drawback of using these mixins is that it becomes\\ndiﬀicult to analyze what a class is doing and which methods to override in case of its\\ncode being too scattered between multiple classes.\\n29.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0What is Django Field Class?\\n'Field' refers to an abstract class that represents a column in the database table.\\xa0\\nThe Field class is just a subclass of RegisterLookupMixin. In Django, these fields are\\nused to create database tables (db_types()) which are used to map Python types to\\nthe database using get_prep_value() and the other way round using from_db_value()\\nmethod. Therefore, fields are fundamental pieces in diﬀerent Django APIs such as\\nmodels and querysets.\\n30.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Why is permanent redirection not a good option?\\nPermanent redirection is used only when you don’t want to lead visitors to the old\\nURLs. The response of the permanent redirections is cached by the browser so when\\nyou try to redirect to something else it will cause issues. Since this is a browser-side\\noperation if your user wants to move to a new page it will load the same page.\\n31.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Diﬀerence between Django OneToOneField and ForeignKey\\nField?\\nBoth of them are of the most common types of fields used in Django. The only\\ndiﬀerence between these two is that ForeignKey field consists of on_delete option\\nalong with a model’s class because it’s used for many-to-one relationships while on\\nthe other hand, the OneToOneField, only carries out a one-to-one relationship and\\nrequires only the model’s class.\\n32.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How can you combine multiple QuerySets in a View?\\nInitially, Concatenating QuerySets into lists is believed to be the easiest approach.\\nHere’s an example of how to do that:\\nfrom itertools import chain\\nresult_list = list(chain(model1_list, model2_list, model3_list))\\nPage 18\\n© Copyright by Interviewbit\"),\n",
